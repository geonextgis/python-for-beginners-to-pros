    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain both data (in the form of fields, also known as attributes or properties) and code (in the form of methods, which are functions). OOP allows for the structuring of software in a way that models real-world entities, making the code more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), we can build our own data types using **classes**. These user-defined data types (also known as **custom classes**) allow us to create objects that represent real-world entities or abstract concepts, with their own attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of relying solely on primitive data types like integers or strings, we can design a class to model more complex data, such as a `Person`, `Car`, or `BankAccount`. Each of these classes can encapsulate specific properties (e.g., name, balance, speed) and behaviors (e.g., withdraw money, accelerate, display information), enabling us to work with these objects in a structured and intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining our own data types, we extend the language’s capabilities and create reusable, modular components that can fit the needs of our particular application. This flexibility is one of the core strengths of OOP, promoting better code organization, readability, and maintainability.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ATM** is the class name.\n",
    "- **Attributes (fields)**:\n",
    "  - `pin`: A private attribute that stores the user's PIN. It's initialized as an empty string.\n",
    "  - `balance`: A private attribute that stores the user's account balance. It's initialized as `0`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Methods (operations)**:\n",
    "  - `__init__()`: The constructor, which initializes the `pin` and `balance` attributes and calls the `menu()` method.\n",
    "  - `menu()`: Displays a menu with options for creating a PIN, changing a PIN, checking balance, withdrawing money, or exiting the program.\n",
    "  - `create_pin()`: Allows the user to create a PIN and set an initial balance.\n",
    "  - `change_pin()`: Allows the user to change the current PIN if the old PIN is correctly provided.\n",
    "  - `check_balance()`: Prompts the user to enter their PIN and displays the account balance if the PIN is correct.\n",
    "  - `withdraw()`: Prompts the user for their PIN and withdraws the specified amount from the account if the PIN is correct and there are sufficient funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In class diagrams, **\"+\"** and **\"-\"** symbols represent the visibility (or access control) of the class members (attributes and methods). Here's what they mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"+\" (Public):**\n",
    "  - This indicates that the attribute or method is **public**, meaning it can be accessed from outside the class. In Python, all attributes and methods are public by default unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"-\" (Private):**\n",
    "  - This indicates that the attribute or method is **private**, meaning it is only accessible from within the class itself and not from outside the class. In Python, you can make an attribute or method private by using a leading double underscore (`__`), though it's more of a convention in Python as the language doesn't enforce strict private access."

    "In Python, the terms **methods** and **functions** are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings based on their context.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Functions:**\n",
    "   - A **function** is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can exist independently and is not associated with any particular object.\n",
    "   - Functions are defined using the `def` keyword and can take inputs (parameters) and return outputs (values).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Methods:**\n",
    "   - A **method** is similar to a function but is associated with an object (an instance of a class). In other words, a method is a function that \"belongs to\" an object.\n",
    "   - Methods are called on objects and can access and modify the data (attributes) within the object they belong to.\n",
    "   - Methods are defined inside a class and must take at least one parameter (`self`), which refers to the instance of the class."

    "**Magic methods** in Python, also known as **dunder (double underscore) methods**, are special methods that allow you to define how objects of a class should behave in certain operations. They have names that begin and end with double underscores (`__`), such as `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`, etc.\n",
